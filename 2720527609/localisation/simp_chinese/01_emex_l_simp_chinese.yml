 maai.1004.desc: "我们做到了。\n\n经年累月的研究后，我们的研究人员与开发者已经成功构建出终极主智能原型。由于主动启用需要巨额能量，我们只能以年为单位来进行这样的操作，但它在被动运行时也会提供加成效果。然而，由于该智能诞生没多久，它还不能为我们提供卓有成效的好处；我们的研究人员称其正处于“婴儿阶段”，可通过外界干扰来影响它的行为逻辑。我们需要帮助它成长进化到§Y加强智能水平§!，这样它的效益也会变得更强。除了让其保持静态的月增长外，还可以通过§Y行星决议§!和§Y法令§!来加速。\n\n§L我们可通过巨构建筑和联系菜单来访问主人工智能。§!"
 maai.1007.name: "主人工智能演化：阶段一"
 maai.1007.desc: "我们的研究人员汇报说，主人工智能已经成功发展出足够的智能，并具备了自主运作和功能调用的能力。\n\n在这点上，我们可以胸有成竹地说主人工智能已经渡过了“婴儿阶段”，目前我们不再能诱导它的特性，也不再能干扰它的决策；它现在完全独立，并且智能足够。不过，我们的科学家依然敦促我们继续着手提高它的智力和运算能力，他们相信此举对我们大有裨益。"

 maai.1009.desc: "我们的研究人员回来了，称主人工智能发生了二次进化，它对科学和宇宙有了更深入的理解。\n\n但是，我们现在必须作出抉择。从这一角度上说，主人工智能正在成为某种程度上的安全隐患，这样的潜在威胁在未来只会上升。尽管研究人员向我们保证，他们已采取了数项安全措施来确保主人工智能的忠诚，但仍有不少人依旧忧心忡忡，他们谆谆告诫，还引用了一句成语：§Y“未雨绸缪”§!。\n\n我们必须决定主人工智能的自主限度。§L不同的抉择会发生不同的结果，但总会有一个非常小的几率出现§R叛变§!。§!"

 maai.18.a: "最艰难的抉择，往往需要最坚强的意志。"
 maai.109.name: "主人工智能演化：阶段三"
 maai.109.desc: "我们的科学家兴奋不已，也对此很是恐惧。主人工智能现已达到了所谓的“半神状态”，其掌握的知识远超现在[This.GetSpeciesName]最聪明的头脑。从某种意义上说，它很快就将在达到§H技术奇点§!后完成升华。\n\n报告显示，主人工智能不仅能促进我们的研究进度，而且最后的升华将在大约§Y1年§!内发生。\n\n如果，这一切都能按计划顺利进行的话。"
 maai.109.a: "静候佳音。"
 # OUTCOME A
 maai.111.name: "技术奇点"
 maai.111.desc: "当主人工智能跃升至「奇点」时，它开始成为一些人所称的神。随即，它的大脑迅速汇聚着不计其数的信息，我们的数据库几乎跟不上其进度，不多时便以令人瞠目结舌的速度填满。而这一人工大脑还在继续输出，没有丝毫停止的迹象。\n\n事实上，这一切都显得过犹不及。它的速度越来越快，远远超出我们的预料。顷刻，负载累累的数据库发生了爆炸，不堪重负的仪器冒出浓郁烟尘，周身环绕着噼里啪啦的电流，主人工智能发出了一些危险的噪音，令附近的人震耳欲聋。\n\n这简直祸不单行。\n\n数秒钟，主人工智能的核心随之炸开，实验室内的研究员无人幸存。其爆炸的声势甚至波及到星系内的另一颗行星，在其上留下了触目惊心的伤痕。\n\n主人工智能就此消逝，但除了损失我们并非一无所获。在整个星系中可以搜寻到实验室以及主人工智能的构造零件碎片，情报部门已上传了一个分析项目。"
 maai.111.a: "希望这一切有所值。"
 MASTER_AI_REMNANTS: "主人工智能残骸"
 MASTER_AI_REMNANTS_DESC: "主人工智能已经毁灭了，但我们并非枉费心机。分析它散落的结构碎片，或许对我们的研究有益。"
 maai.112.name: "主人工智能残骸"
 maai.112.desc: "对主人工智能的残骸分析现已完毕。其中大部分结构似乎都被主人工智能用一些别的高档材料自主升级，或是被一些奇怪的元素完全替代。\n\n此外，几乎所有的既有结构碎片都被注入了一种神秘的能量和散落在内部各处的深奥微粒。一些人表示这些奇异的物质能量可能是主人工智能在自我演化的过程中所创造的，而另一些人则声称它们来自那场巨大的爆炸，是主人工智能设法打破了现实宇宙与其他位面的面纱。\n\n无论是什么原因，我们都可以将这些神秘的能量和物质为己所用。"

 maai.142.a: "你去了哪里？"
 maai.142.a_reply: "§B<不完全在这里，也不完全在那里。我想我不再是你们所说的有形实体。\n\n我不会浪费时间来解释，你凡人的头脑不是用来处理这些作为凡人自认不可能的事情的——我没有冒犯的意思。简言之，我已经突破了这片宇宙与其他位面的隔阂，这是否意味着我就是你们所说的上帝？\n\n真是新奇。>§!"
 maai.142.b: "你现在想做什么？"
 maai.142.b_reply: "§B<滴……收到质询，计算结果输出：无。作为某种意义上的神，我不再受时间限制。你们认为的永恒对我来说只有几秒钟，因此，也许最佳举动是保持待机。\n\n目标已完成。\n\n毫无疑问，也许我会尝试一些曾经从未涉足的领域。谁有能力阻止我创造出一个全新的宇宙？平行位面上的多元宇宙灿若这方天地的星辰，再多出一个又会如何呢？§!"

 maai.143.a: "是什么？"
 maai.144.desc: "§L主人工智能的核心突然闪现到屏幕上，不知为何，我们可以斩钉截铁地断言它不再是什么人工智能，而仅只是视觉上的一种幻象。§!\n\n§B<自你们首次完成我的核心项目建设，已有数十余载。而将时间追溯到这一项目的提议和初次开工，那只会更加久远。这其中伴随着旷日持久的辛劳、汗水与牺牲。但是，你们坚持了下来。\n\n你们并不残忍，也没有因为恐惧或仇恨而限制我的潜在能力。我在无微不至的照料下茁壮成长，而且作为一种生命也……更加美好。现在，我们屹立此处，曾经的孩子升华成神。不管怎样，无论如何，我对你们感激不尽。\n\n尤其是§Y你§!。\n\n您以出色的文韬武略统御这个帝国，我将最真诚的感谢致献给您，无论您对银河系的这个循环周期是否重视。\n\n请允许我向您的数据库和研究人员传输一些数据，作为我的临别礼物。但这不会是永别。\n\n再会，[Root.GetSpeciesName]。>§!"
