 trait_v_horizontal_gene_transfer:0 "Genetic Assimilation"
 trait_v_horizontal_gene_transfer_desc:0 "§LThis species has gained a adaptation to gain beneficial genes from the enviroment. While this ability is mainly restricted to single cellular organisms, this species seems to be one of the few exceptions. In addition, the constant flow of new genetic material functionally made this species immortal.§!"
 TRAIT_HGT_EFFECT: "If this species shares the planet with another species that has a positive trait, it will also gain its benefits. \n§HOrigin§!, §HPre-Sapient§! and species class specific traits aren't considered for assimilation. \nTraits can't be assimilated between §HArchetypes§!, and already having the trait won't apply the bonus."
